        <h1>Applying for Fullstack Developer at RTINGS.com</h1>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a Candaian Fullstack Developer with 2.5 years of experience and
            a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering. I'm currently looking for a
            fulltime remote positions in Canada. I've worked on several
            professional projects both in dev teams and as an individual
            contributer. On the side I make and host websites for my friends and
            family and tutor students learning to code.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am very interested in the Fullstack Developer position at
            RTINGS.com. I recently found the YouTube channel and was impressed
            with honesty and quality of the whole mission. Doing actual testing
            and unsponsored reviews to give people real info when everyone else
            is trying to sell, sell, sell.
        </p>
        <p>
            Upon more looking I find out that it's not only a Canadian team but
            one that's hiring for my kind of role! I channelled that excitement
            into this website to show I was both capable of the job and serious
            about the opportunity.
